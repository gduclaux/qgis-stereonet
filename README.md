# qgis-stereonet
 WAXI QFIELD Fork of steronet plugin

# Source
 All the hard work was carried out by https://github.com/childsd3 and https://github.com/joferkington/mplstereonet
 
## Usage
 1- Download zip file from github, install into QGIS using plugin manager   
 2- Select a layer that has structural info, then select the points you want to plot   
 3- You can use the WAXI QFIELD Plugin to control display behaviour   
 4- Click on WAXI Stereonet icon    ![plugin_icon](icon.png)  
 
 ## Roadmap:
-	Plot poles and/or great circles for planes (user choice?),  Done using WAXI QFIELD Plugin for control 
-	Plot great circles and poles of planes on which lines lie when the information is available,   Done (I think?)
-	Plot the hanging wall relative motion vector with an arrow on pole symbol if kinematic information is available.
